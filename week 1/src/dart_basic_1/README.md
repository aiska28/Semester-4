Practical Work Steps
1. Install Android Studio and Flutter. In Flutter, first extract the files, then insert the Flutter bin file. After that, run 'flutter doctir' where I encountered two problems. The first was that the SDK command line was not available, so I ran the installer. After that, copy the text according to the instructions in the command prompt.
2. Display Hello World and 42. We write this in bin bin and then call the function in lib.
3. Calculate the area of a triangle. Main calls the constructor in lib. Inside the constructor, we input variables luas and tinggi.
